/*
 * MobilePhone Challenge (Tim Buchalka's Java Masterclass)
 *
 * Your job is to create a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities.
 *
 * 1. Create a class called Contact.
 *    - It has two fields: name and phoneNumber (both Strings).
 *    - A constructor to initialize the name and phoneNumber.
 *    - Two getters: getName() and getPhoneNumber().
 *    - A static method createContact(String name, String phoneNumber) that returns a new Contact object.
 *
 * 2. Create a class called MobilePhone.
 *    - It has two fields:
 *        - myNumber (String)
 *        - myContacts (ArrayList of Contact)
 *    - A constructor that takes the phone number and initializes both fields.
 *
 * Implement the following methods in MobilePhone:
 *
 * - boolean addNewContact(Contact contact)
 *     -> Adds a new contact if it doesn't already exist (by name).
 *
 * - boolean updateContact(Contact oldContact, Contact newContact)
 *     -> Updates an existing contact to a new contact.
 *
 * - boolean removeContact(Contact contact)
 *     -> Removes a contact if it exists.
 *
 * - private int findContact(Contact contact)
 *     -> Returns the index of the contact, or -1 if not found.
 *
 * - private int findContact(String name)
 *     -> Returns the index of the contact with the given name, or -1 if not found.
 *
 * - public Contact queryContact(String name)
 *     -> Returns the Contact object with the given name, or null if not found.
 *
 * - public void printContacts()
 *     -> Prints the contact list in the format:
 *        Contact List:
 *        1. Bob -> 31415926
 *        2. Alice -> 16180339
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - Use findContact() inside other methods to avoid duplicate code.
 * - Two contacts are considered equal if their names are equal.
 * - All fields must be private.
 * - All methods must be public unless specified.
 * - Do NOT include a main method.
