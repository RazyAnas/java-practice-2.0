/*
QUESTION: Complex Number Operations

Write a class named `ComplexNumber` with the following:

Fields:
- private double real
- private double imaginary

Constructor:
- ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary)

Methods:
1. `getReal()` – returns the real part
2. `getImaginary()` – returns the imaginary part
3. `add(double real, double imaginary)` – adds to the current real and imaginary values
4. `add(ComplexNumber other)` – adds another ComplexNumber to this one
5. `subtract(double real, double imaginary)` – subtracts from the current real and imaginary values
6. `subtract(ComplexNumber other)` – subtracts another ComplexNumber from this one

NOTE:
- All methods should be public.
- No main method should be added to the class.
