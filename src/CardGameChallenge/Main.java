🃏 What is War?
A two-player game where:
    Each player is dealt half the deck (26 cards each).
    In each round, both players flip their top card.
    The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards to the bottom of their deck.
    If the cards are equal → it's WAR! (tie-breaker round).
    Game ends when one player has all the cards, or you stop after a number of rounds.
