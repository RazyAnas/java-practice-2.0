public class Constructor {
    // constructor is used in the creation of an object.
    // it is a special type of code block that has a specific name and parameters, much like a method.
    // it has the same name as the class itself, and it doesn't return any values.
    // you never include a return type from a constructor, not even void.
    // constructor chaining with this(), constructor chaining is when one constructor explicitly calls another overloaded constructor
